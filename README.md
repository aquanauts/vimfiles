# Aquatic Shared Vim Config

This isn't used by every programmer at Aquatic, but it's used by some of them.

## Goals (in progress)

* Wherever possible, rely on default keybindings. 
* Works in Ubuntu OS X terminals, so you can easily use it when working remotely.
* Oriented around buffers instead of tabs, using airline and CTRL-P for navigation.
* Easy to add and update plugins, with support for fixing to a specific version if necessary.
* Works well with the following languages and testing frameworks:
  * Bash
  * JavaScript/Jasmine
  * Python
  * HTML (w/ Sparkup)
  * CSS
* Support across all languages for:
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Formatting
  * Tags
  * Omni-complete
  * Snippets
* Includes (jrsacks)[https://github.com/jrsacks]'s test splitter.
